## New Animation structure:

As you might have noticed, loading your animations as usual doesnt quite work anymore. This is because we are in Phase two of the new improved animation handler. Right now, it allows for two manifests (SFW & NSFW) which can ofc both be modified. In the future, it will allow for an infinite amount of animations.

The new folder structure as of rn is:
```
--dolphin
     |----sfw
     |
     |----nsfw
            |----lvl_1
            |----lvl_2
            |         \__frame_00.bm, frame_01.bm ...
            |                
            |----manifest.txt
```
In the future, this allows you to just create a new folder with any name, and drop your animations & manifest inside it. The firmware will have a slider to select your animation. Right now you can only modify these two folders with your custom animations.


## What does this change for me?

Not much, actually. For now, just make sure your animations and the manifest are in one of these folders, and for the manifest.txt there is only one important note: instead of `Name: lvl_8` it is now `Name: nsfw\lvl_8`. Simply adding *folderpath\\* to the name fixes your animations, and makes them compatible with the new and soon highly advanced animation system!

## How do I even get animations to put them there?

I recommend watching this wonderful video for how to do it: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq5DXhOMo5s>
