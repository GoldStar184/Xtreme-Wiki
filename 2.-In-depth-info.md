Here we will talk about some more technical stuff. How do certain apps work, unit tests, FBT, etc.

This is not needed for the average user, but probably interesting / helpful for developers.

<summary>1. Sub-Ghz Frequencies</summary>

#### CC1101 Frequency range specs: 300-348 MHz, 386-464 MHz, and 778-928 MHz 

Edit user settings file located on your microSD card - `subghz/assets/setting_user.txt`

in this file you will find we already have extra frequencies added
if you need your custom one, make sure it doesn't listed here

### Default frequency list
```
    /* 300 - 348 */
    300000000,
    303875000,
    304250000,
    310000000,
    315000000,
    318000000,

    /* 387 - 464 */
    390000000,
    418000000,
    433075000, /* LPD433 first */
    433420000,
    433920000  /* LPD433 mid */
    434420000,
    434775000, /* LPD433 last channels */
    438900000,

    /* 779 - 928 */
    868350000,
    915000000,
    925000000,
```

### User frequencies added AFTER that default list! You need to continue until you reach the end of that list

### If you want to disable default list and use ONLY user added frequecies from user settings file
Change that line
`#Add_standard_frequencies: true`
to
`Add_standard_frequencies: false`

### To add your own frequency to user list 
Just add new line
`Frequency: 928000000` - where `928000000` is your frequency, keep it in that format! it should be 9 digits!

### Hopper frequency list
To add new frequecy to hopper:
add new line `Hopper_frequency: 345000000`<br>
But remember! You should keep it as small as possible, or hopper functionality would be useless!<br>
If `#Add_standard_frequencies: true` is not changed<br>
Your frequencies will be added after default ones

### Default hopper list
```
    310000000,
    315000000,
    318000000,
    390000000,
    433920000,
    868350000,

If the nRF module is acting a bit flakey, try adding a capacitor to the vcc/gnd lines! 
I've not tried the Plus model so it may have a bigger need for a cap. 
Otherwise, I haven't had any major issues. 
Anything from a 3.3 uF to 10 uF should do. (Watch your positive/negative placement! Negative to ground.) 
I learned if you wanna get fancy, include a 0.1 uF cap in parallel. 
The 3.3 uF to 10 uF will respond to slow freq changes while the 0.1 uF will respond to the high freq switching spikes that the larger one cannot. That said, a single 10 uF will likely suffice for the Mousejack attack. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

<summary>3. App Manifests</summary>

# Flipper Application Manifests (.fam)

All components of Flipper Zero firmware — services, user applications, and system settings — are developed independently. Each component has a build system manifest file, named `application.fam`, which defines the basic properties of that component and its relations to other parts of the system.

When building firmware, **`fbt`** collects all application manifests and processes their dependencies. Then it builds only those components referenced in the current build configuration. See [fbt docs](./fbt.md#firmware-application-set) for details on build configurations.

## Application definition

A firmware component's properties are declared in a Python code snippet, forming a call to App() function with various parameters.

Only 2 parameters are mandatory: ***appid*** and ***apptype***; others are optional and may only be meaningful for certain application types.

### Parameters

* **appid**: string, application id within the build system. Used to specify which applications to include in the build configuration and resolve dependencies and conflicts.

* **apptype**: member of FlipperAppType.* enumeration. Valid values are:

| Enum member  | Firmware component type  |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| SERVICE      | System service, created at early startup  |
| SYSTEM       | Application is not being shown in any menus. It can be started by other apps or from CLI  |
| APP          | Regular application for the main menu |
| PLUGIN       | Application to be built as a part of the firmware and to be placed in the Plugins menu |
| DEBUG        | Application only visible in Debug menu with debug mode enabled |
| ARCHIVE      | One and only Archive app |
| SETTINGS     | Application to be placed in the system settings menu |
| STARTUP      | Callback function to run at system startup. Does not define a separate app |
| EXTERNAL     | Application to be built as .fap plugin |
| METAPACKAGE  | Does not define any code to be run, used for declaring dependencies and application bundles |

* **name**: Name that is displayed in menus.
* **entry_point**: C function to be used as the application's entry point. Note that C++ function names are mangled, so you need to wrap them in `extern "C"` to use them as entry points.
* **flags**: Internal flags for system apps. Do not use.
* **cdefines**: C preprocessor definitions to declare globally for other apps when the current application is included in the active build configuration.
* **requires**: List of application IDs to include in the build configuration when the current application is referenced in the list of applications to build.
* **conflicts**: List of application IDs that the current application conflicts with. If any of them is found in the constructed application list, **`fbt`** will abort the firmware build process.
* **provides**: Functionally identical to ***requires*** field.
* **stack_size**: Stack size, in bytes, to allocate for application on its startup. Note that allocating a stack too small for an app to run will cause a system crash due to stack overflow, and allocating too much stack space will reduce usable heap memory size for apps to process data. *Note: you can use `ps`, and `free` CLI commands to profile your app's memory usage.*
* **icon**: Animated icon name from built-in assets to be used when building the app as a part of the firmware.
* **order**: Order of an application within its group when sorting entries in it. The lower the order is, the closer to the start of the list the item is placed. *Used for ordering startup hooks and menu entries.*
* **sdk_headers**: List of C header files from this app's code to include in API definitions for external applications.
* **targets**: list of strings, target names, which this application is compatible with. If not specified, the application is built for all targets. The default value is `["all"]`.


#### Parameters for external applications

The following parameters are used only for [FAPs](./AppsOnSDCard.md):

* **sources**: list of strings, file name masks used for gathering sources within the app folder. The default value of `["*.c*"]` includes C and C++ source files. Applications cannot use the `"lib"` folder for their own source code, as it is reserved for **fap_private_libs**.
* **fap_version**: tuple, 2 numbers in the form of (x,y): application version to be embedded within .fap file. The default value is (0,1), meaning version "0.1".
* **fap_icon**: name of a .png file, 1-bit color depth, 10x10px, to be embedded within .fap file.
* **fap_libs**: list of extra libraries to link the application against. Provides access to extra functions that are not exported as a part of main firmware at the expense of increased .fap file size and RAM consumption.
* **fap_category**: string, may be empty. App subcategory, also determines the path of the FAP within apps folder in the file system.
* **fap_description**: string, may be empty. Short application description.
* **fap_author**: string, may be empty. Application's author.
* **fap_weburl**: string, may be empty. Application's homepage.
* **fap_icon_assets**: string. If present defines a folder name to be used for gathering image assets for this application. These images will be preprocessed and built alongside the application. See [FAP assets](./AppsOnSDCard.md#fap-assets) for details.
* **fap_extbuild**: provides support for parts of application sources to be built by external tools. Contains a list of `ExtFile(path="file name", command="shell command")` definitions. **`fbt`** will run the specified command for each file in the list.

Note that commands are executed at the firmware root folder's root, and all intermediate files must be placed in an application's temporary build folder. For that, you can use pattern expansion by **`fbt`**: `${FAP_WORK_DIR}` will be replaced with the path to the application's temporary build folder, and `${FAP_SRC_DIR}` will be replaced with the path to the application's source folder. You can also use other variables defined internally by **`fbt`**.


Example for building an app from Rust sources:

```python
    sources=["target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/libhello_rust.a"],
    fap_extbuild=(
        ExtFile(
            path="${FAP_WORK_DIR}/target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/libhello_rust.a",
            command="cargo build --release --verbose --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf --target-dir ${FAP_WORK_DIR}/target --manifest-path ${FAP_SRC_DIR}/Cargo.toml",
        ),
    ),
```

* **fap_private_libs**: a list of additional libraries distributed as sources alongside the application. These libraries will be built as a part of the application build process.
Library sources must be placed in a subfolder of "`lib`" folder within the application's source folder.
Each library is defined as a call to `Lib()` function, accepting the following parameters:

    - **name**: name of library's folder. Required.
    - **fap_include_paths**: list of library's relative paths to add to parent fap's include path list. The default value is `["."]` meaning the library's source root.
    - **sources**: list of filename masks to be used for gathering include files for this library. Paths are relative to the library's source root. The default value is `["*.c*"]`.
    - **cflags**: list of additional compiler flags to be used for building this library. The default value is `[]`.
    - **cdefines**: list of additional preprocessor definitions to be used for building this library. The default value is `[]`.
    - **cincludes**: list of additional include paths to be used for building this library. Paths are relative to the application's root. This can be used for providing external search paths for this library's code - for configuration headers. The default value is `[]`.

Example for building an app with a private library:

```python
    fap_private_libs=[
            Lib(
                name="mbedtls",
                fap_include_paths=["include"],
                sources=[
                    "library/des.c",
                    "library/sha1.c",
                    "library/platform_util.c",
                ],
                cdefines=["MBEDTLS_ERROR_C"],
            ),
            Lib(
                name="loclass",
                cflags=["-Wno-error"],
            ),
        ],
```

For that snippet, **`fbt`** will build 2 libraries: one from sources in `lib/mbedtls` folder and another from sources in `lib/loclass` folder. For the `mbedtls` library, **`fbt`** will add `lib/mbedtls/include` to the list of include paths for the application and compile only the files specified in the `sources` list. Additionally, **`fbt`** will enable `MBEDTLS_ERROR_C` preprocessor definition for `mbedtls` sources.
For the `loclass` library, **`fbt`** will add `lib/loclass` to the list of the include paths for the application and build all sources in that folder. Also, **`fbt`** will disable treating compiler warnings as errors for the `loclass` library, which can be useful when compiling large 3rd-party codebases.

Both libraries will be linked with the application.


## .fam file contents

.fam file contains one or more Application definitions. For example, here's a part of `applications/service/bt/application.fam`:

```python
App(
    appid="bt_start",
    apptype=FlipperAppType.STARTUP,
    entry_point="bt_on_system_start",
    order=70,
)

App(
    appid="bt_settings",
    name="Bluetooth",
    apptype=FlipperAppType.SETTINGS,
    entry_point="bt_settings_app",
    stack_size=1 * 1024,
    requires=[
        "bt",
        "gui",
    ],
    order=10,
)
```

For more examples, see .fam files from various firmware parts.

<summary>4. Unit Tests</summary>

## Intro
Unit tests are special pieces of code that apply known inputs to the feature code and check the results to see if they were correct. 
They are crucial for writing robust, bug-free code.

Flipper Zero firmware includes a separate application called [unit_tests](/applications/debug/unit_tests).
It is run directly on the Flipper Zero in order to employ its hardware features and to rule out any platform-related differences.

When contributing code to the Flipper Zero firmware, it is highly desirable to supply unit tests along with the proposed features. 
Running existing unit tests is useful to ensure that the new code doesn't introduce any regressions.

## Running unit tests
In order to run the unit tests, follow these steps:
1. Compile the firmware with the tests enabled: `./fbt FIRMWARE_APP_SET=unit_tests`.
2. Flash the firmware using your preferred method.
3. Copy the [assets/unit_tests](assets/unit_tests) folder to the root of your Flipper Zero's SD card.
4. Launch the CLI session and run the `unit_tests` command.

**NOTE:** To run a particular test (and skip all others), specify its name as the command argument. 
See [test_index.c](applications/debug/unit_tests/test_index.c) for the complete list of test names.

## Adding unit tests
### General
#### Entry point
The common entry point for all tests is the [unit_tests](applications/debug/unit_tests) application. Test-specific code is placed into an arbitrarily named subdirectory and is then called from the [test_index.c](applications/debug/unit_tests/test_index.c) source file.
#### Test assets
Some unit tests require external data in order to function. These files (commonly called assets) reside in the [assets/unit_tests](/assets/unit_tests) directory in their respective subdirectories. Asset files can be of any type (plain text, FlipperFormat(FFF), binary, etc).
### Application-specific
#### Infrared
Each infrared protocol has a corresponding set of unit tests, so it makes sense to implement one when adding support for a new protocol.
In order to add unit tests for your protocol, follow these steps:
1. Create a file named `test_<your_protocol_name>.irtest` in the [assets](assets/unit_tests/infrared) directory.
2. Fill it with the test data (more on it below).
3. Add the test code to [infrared_test.c](applications/debug/unit_tests/infrared/infrared_test.c).
4. Update the [assets](assets/unit_tests/infrared) on your Flipper Zero and run the tests to see if they pass.

##### Test data format
Each unit test has 3 sections: 
1. `decoder` - takes in raw signal and outputs decoded messages.
2. `encoder` - takes in decoded messages and outputs a raw signal.
3. `encoder_decoder` - takes in decoded messages, turns them into a raw signal, and then decodes again. 

Infrared test asset files have an `.irtest` extension and are regular `.ir` files with a few additions.
Decoder input data has signal names `decoder_input_N`, where N is a test sequence number. Expected data goes under the name `decoder_expected_N`. When testing the encoder these two are switched.

Decoded data is represented in arrays (since a single raw signal may decode to several messages). If there is only one signal, then it has to be an array of size 1. Use the existing files as syntax examples.

##### Getting raw signals
Recording raw IR signals are possible using the Flipper Zero. Launch the CLI session, run `ir rx raw`, then point the remote towards Flipper's receiver and send the signals. The raw signal data will be printed to the console in a convenient format.

<summary>5. OTA Updates</summary>

# Executing code from RAM

In Flipper firmware, we have a special boot mode that loads a specially crafted system image into RAM and transfers control to it. System image executing in RAM has full write access to whole Flipper's flash memory — something that's not possible when running main code from same flash.

We leverage that boot mode to perform OTA firmware updates, including operations on radio stack running on second MCU core.


# How does Flipper OTA work?

Installation of OTA updates goes through 3 stages:

## 1. Backing up internal storage (`/int/`)

It is a special partition of Flipper's flash memory, taking up all available space not used by firmware code. Newer versions of firmware may be of different size, and simply installing them would cause flash repartitioning and data loss.

So, before taking any action upon the firmware, we back up current configuration from `/int/` into a plain tar archive on SD card.


## 2. Performing device update

For that, main firmware loads an updater image - a customized build of main Flipper firmware — into RAM and runs it. Updater performs operations on system flash that are described by an Update manifest file.

First, if there's a Radio stack image bundled with the update, updater compares its version with currently installed one. If they don't match, updater performs stack deinstallation followed by writing and installing a new one. The installation itself is performed by proprietary software, FUS, running on Core2, and leads to a series of system restarts.

Then updater validates and corrects Option Bytes — a special memory region containing low-level configuration for Flipper's MCU.

After that, updater loads a `.dfu` file with firmware to be flashed, checks its integrity using CRC32, writes it to system flash and validates written data.


## 3. Restoring internal storage and updating resources

After performing operations on flash memory, system restarts into newly flashed firmware. Then it performs restoration of previously backed up `/int` contents.

If update package contains an additional resources archive, it is extracted onto SD card.


# Update manifest

Update packages come with a manifest that contains a description of its contents. The manifest is in Flipper File Format — a simple text file, comprised of key-value pairs.

## Mandatory fields

Update manifest must contain the following keys in given order:

* __Filetype__: a constant string, "Flipper firmware upgrade configuration";

* __Version__: manifest version. Current value is 2;

* __Info__: arbitraty string, describing package contents;

* __Target__: hardware revision the package is built for;

* __Loader__: file name of stage 2 loader that is executed from RAM;

* __Loader CRC__: CRC32 of loader file. Note that it is represented in little-endian hex.

## Optional fields

Other fields may have empty values, is such case updater skips all operations related to such values.

* __Radio__: file name of radio stack image, provided by STM;

* __Radio address__: address to install the radio stack at. It is specified in Release Notes by STM;

* __Radio version__: Radio major, minor and sub versions followed by branch, release, and stack type packed into 6 hex-encoded bytes;

* __Radio CRC__: CRC32 of radio image;

* __Resources__: file name of TAR acrhive with resources to be extracted on SD card;

* __OB reference__, __OB mask__, __OB write mask__: reference values for validating and correcting option bytes.


# OTA update error codes

We designed the OTA update process to be as fail-safe as possible. We don't start any risky operation before validating all related pieces of data to ensure we don't leave the device in partially updated, or bricked, state.

Even if something goes wrong, Updater gives you an option to retry failed operations, and reports its state with an error code. These error codes have an `[XX-YY]` format, where `XX` encodes an operation that failed, and `YY` contains extra details on its progress where the error occured.

|    Stage description    |   Code | Progress   | Description                                |

To build minimal update package, including only firmware, run `./fbt COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 updater_minpackage`


## Customizing update bundles

Default update packages are built with Bluetooth Light stack. 
You can pick a different stack, if your firmware version supports it, and build a bundle with it passing stack type and binary name to `fbt`: 

`./fbt updater_package COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 COPRO_OB_DATA=scripts/ob_custradio.data COPRO_STACK_BIN=stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin COPRO_STACK_TYPE=ble_full`  

Note that `COPRO_OB_DATA` must point to a valid file in `scripts` folder containing reference Option Byte data matching to your radio stack type.

In certain cases, you might have to confirm your intentions by adding `COPRO_DISCLAIMER=...` to the build command line.


## Building partial update packages

You can customize package contents by calling `scripts/update.py` directly. 
For example, to build a package only for installing BLE FULL stack:

```shell
scripts/update.py generate \
	-t f7 -d r13.3_full -v "BLE FULL 13.3" \
	--stage dist/f7/flipper-z-f7-updater-*.bin \
	--radio lib/STM32CubeWB/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin \
	--radiotype ble_full
```

For full list of options, check `scripts/update.py generate` help.

<summary>6. FBT</summary>

FBT is the entry point for firmware-related commands and utilities.
It is invoked by `./fbt` in the firmware project root directory. Internally, it is a wrapper around [scons](https://scons.org/) build system.

## Requirements

Please install Python packages required by assets build scripts: `pip3 install -r scripts/requirements.txt`

## NB

* `fbt` constructs all referenced environments & their targets' dependency trees on startup. So, to keep startup time as low as possible, we're hiding construction of certain targets behind command-line options.
* `fbt` always performs `git submodule update --init` on start, unless you set `FBT_NO_SYNC=1` in environment:
    * On Windows, that's `set "FBT_NO_SYNC=1"` in the shell you're running `fbt` from
    * On \*nix, it's `$ FBT_NO_SYNC=1 ./fbt ...`
* `fbt` builds updater & firmware in separate subdirectories in `build`, with their names depending on optimization settings (`COMPACT` & `DEBUG` options). However, for ease of integration with IDEs, latest built variant's directory is always linked as `built/latest`. Additionally, `compile_commands.json` is generated in that folder, which is used for code completion support in IDE.

## Invoking FBT

To build with FBT, call it specifying configuration options & targets to build. For example,

`./fbt COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 VERBOSE=1 updater_package copro_dist`

To run cleanup (think of `make clean`) for specified targets, add `-c` option.

## VSCode integration

`fbt` includes basic development environment configuration for VSCode. To deploy it, run `./fbt vscode_dist`. That will copy initial environment configuration to `.vscode` folder. After that, you can use that configuration by starting VSCode and choosing firmware root folder in "File > Open Folder" menu.

 * On first start, you'll be prompted to install recommended plug-ins. Please install them for best development experience. _You can find a list of them in `.vscode/extensions.json`._
 * Basic build tasks are invoked in Ctrl+Shift+B menu.
 * Debugging requires a supported probe. That includes:
    * Wi-Fi devboard with stock firmware (blackmagic),
    * ST-Link and compatible devices,
    * J-Link for flashing and debugging (in VSCode only). _Note that J-Link tools are not included with our toolchain and you have to [download](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) them yourself and put on your system's PATH._
 * Without a supported probe, you can install firmware on Flipper using USB installation method.


## FBT targets

FBT keeps track of internal dependencies, so you only need to build the highest-level target you need, and FBT will make sure everything they depend on is up-to-date.

### High-level (what you most likely need)
 
- `fw_dist` - build & publish firmware to `dist` folder. This is a default target, when no other are specified
- `fap_dist` - build external plugins & publish to `dist` folder  
- `updater_package`, `updater_minpackage` - build self-update package. Minimal version only includes firmware's DFU file; full version also includes radio stack & resources for SD card
- `copro_dist` - bundle Core2 FUS+stack binaries for qFlipper
- `flash` - flash attached device with OpenOCD over ST-Link
- `flash_usb`, `flash_usb_full` - build, upload and install update package to device over USB. See details on `updater_package`, `updater_minpackage` 
- `debug` - build and flash firmware, then attach with gdb with firmware's .elf loaded
- `debug_other`, `debug_other_blackmagic` - attach gdb without loading any .elf. Allows to manually add external elf files with `add-symbol-file` in gdb
- `updater_debug` - attach gdb with updater's .elf loaded
- `blackmagic` - debug firmware with Blackmagic probe (WiFi dev board)
- `openocd` - just start OpenOCD
- `get_blackmagic` - output blackmagic address in gdb remote format. Useful for IDE integration
- `get_stlink` - output serial numbers for attached STLink probes. Used for specifying an adapter with `OPENOCD_ADAPTER_SERIAL=...`.
- `lint`, `format` - run clang-format on C source code to check and reformat it according to `.clang-format` specs
- `lint_py`, `format_py` - run [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) on Python source code, build system files & application manifests 
- `cli` - start Flipper CLI session over USB

### Firmware targets

- `faps` - build all external & plugin apps as [.faps](./AppsOnSDCard.md#fap-flipper-application-package). 
- **`fbt`** also defines per-app targets. For example, for an app with `appid=snake_game` target names are:
    - `fap_snake_game`, etc - build single app as .fap by its application ID.
    - Check out [`--extra-ext-apps`](#command-line-parameters) for force adding extra apps to external build
    - `fap_snake_game_list`, etc - generate source + assembler listing for app's .fap
- `flash`, `firmware_flash` - flash current version to attached device with OpenOCD over ST-Link
- `jflash` - flash current version to attached device with JFlash using J-Link probe. JFlash executable must be on your $PATH
- `flash_blackmagic` - flash current version to attached device with Blackmagic probe
- `firmware_all`, `updater_all` - build basic set of binaries
- `firmware_list`, `updater_list` - generate source + assembler listing
- `firmware_cdb`, `updater_cdb` - generate `compilation_database.json` file for external tools and IDEs. It can be created without actually building the firmware. 

### Assets

- `resources` - build resources and their Manifest
    - `dolphin_ext` - process dolphin animations for SD card 
- `icons` - generate .c+.h for icons from png assets
- `proto` - generate .pb.c+.pb.h for .proto sources
- `proto_ver` - generate .h with protobuf version 
- `dolphin_internal`, `dolphin_blocking` - generate .c+.h for corresponding dolphin assets
 

## Command-line parameters

- `--options optionfile.py` (default value `fbt_options.py`) - load file with multiple configuration values
- `--extra-int-apps=app1,app2,appN` - forces listed apps to be built as internal with `firmware` target
- `--extra-ext-apps=app1,app2,appN` - forces listed apps to be built as external with `firmware_extapps` target
- `--proxy-env=VAR1,VAR2` - additional environment variables to expose to subprocesses spawned by `fbt`. By default, `fbt` sanitizes execution environment and doesn't forward all inherited environment variables. You can find list of variables that are always forwarded in `environ.scons` file. 


## Configuration 

Default configuration variables are set in the configuration file `fbt_options.py`. 
Values set on command-line have higher precedence over configuration file.

You can find out available options with `./fbt -h`.

### Firmware application set

You can create customized firmware builds by modifying the application list to be included in the build. Application presets are configured with the `FIRMWARE_APPS` option, which is a map(configuration_name:str -> application_list:tuple(str)). To specify application set to use in a build, set `FIRMWARE_APP_SET` to its name.
For example, to build a firmware image with unit tests, run `./fbt FIRMWARE_APP_SET=unit_tests`.

Check out `fbt_options.py` for details.
