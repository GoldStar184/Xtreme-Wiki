    protocol: SIRC
    address: 01 00 00 00
    command: 15 00 00 00

### Description
Filename extension: `.ir`

This file format is used to store an infrared remote that consists of an arbitrary number of buttons. 
Each button is separated from others by a comment character (`#`) for better readability.

Known protocols are represented in the `parsed` form, whereas non-recognised signals may be saved and re-transmitted as `raw` data.

#### Version history:
1. Initial version.

#### Format fields
| Name       | Use     | Type   | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |------------ |
| name       | both    | string | Name of the button. Only printable ASCII characters are allowed. |
| type       | both    | string | Type of the signal. Must be `parsed` or `raw`.  |
| protocol   | parsed  | string | Name of the infrared protocol. Refer to `ir` console command for the complete list of supported protocols. |
| address    | parsed  | hex    | Payload address. Must be 4 bytes long. |
| command    | parsed  | hex    | Payload command. Must be 4 bytes long. |
| frequency  | raw     | uint32 | Carrier frequency, in Hertz, usually 38000 Hz. |
| duty_cycle | raw     | float  | Carrier duty cycle, usually 0.33. |
| data       | raw     | uint32 | Raw signal timings, in microseconds between logic level changes. Individual elements must be space-separated. Maximum timings amount is 1024. |

## Infrared Library File Format
### Examples
- [TV Universal Library](/assets/resources/infrared/assets/tv.ir)
- [A/C Universal Library](/assets/resources/infrared/assets/ac.ir)
- [Audio Universal Library](/assets/resources/infrared/assets/audio.ir)

### Description
Filename extension: `.ir`

This file format is used to store universal remote libraries. It is identical to the previous format, differing only in the `Filetype` field.\
It also has predefined button names for each universal library type, so that the universal remote application could understand them.
See [Universal Remotes](/documentation/UniversalRemotes.md) for more information.

### Version history:
1. Initial version.

## Infrared Test File Format
### Examples
See [Infrared Unit Tests](/assets/unit_tests/infrared/) for various examples.
### Description
Filename extension: `.irtest`

This file format is used to store technical test data that is too large to keep directly in the firmware.
It is mostly similar to the two previous formats, with the main difference being the addition of the parsed signal arrays.

Each infrared protocol must have corresponding unit tests complete with an `.irtest` file.

Known protocols are represented in the `parsed_array` form, whereas raw data has the `raw` type.\
Note: a single parsed signal must be represented as an array of size 1.

### Version history:
1. Initial version.

#### Format fields
| Name       | Use          | Type   | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------ |------------ |
| name       | both         | string | Name of the signal. Only printable ASCII characters are allowed. |
| type       | both         | string | Type of the signal. Must be `parsed_array` or `raw`.  |
| count      | parsed_array | uint32 | The number of parsed signals in an array. Must be at least 1. |
| protocol   | parsed_array | string | Same as in previous formats. |
| address    | parsed_array | hex    | Ditto. |
| command    | parsed_array | hex    | Ditto. |
| repeat     | parsed_array | bool   | Indicates whether the signal is a repeated button press. |
| frequency  | raw          | uint32 | Same as in previous formats. |
| duty_cycle | raw          | float  | Ditto. |
| data       | raw          | uint32 | Ditto. |

#### Signal names
The signal names in an `.irtest` file follow a convention `<name><test_number>`, where the name is one of:
- decoder_input
- decoder_expected
- encoder_decoder_input,

and the number is a sequential integer: 1, 2, 3...etc, which produces names like `decoder_input1`, `encoder_decoder_input3`, and so on.

| Name                  | Type         | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------ |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| decoder_input         | raw          | A raw signal containing the decoder input. Is also used as the expected encoder output.               |
| decoder_expected      | parsed_array | An array of parsed signals containing the expected decoder output. Is also used as the encoder input. |
| encoder_decoder_input | parsed_array | An array of parsed signals containing both the encoder-decoder input and expected output.             |

<summary>4. NFC</summary>

## NFC-A (UID) + Header

### Example

    Filetype: Flipper NFC device
    Version: 3
    # Nfc device type can be UID, Mifare Ultralight, Mifare Classic, Bank card
    Device type: UID
    # UID, ATQA and SAK are common for all formats
    UID: 04 85 92 8A A0 61 81
    ATQA: 00 44
    SAK: 00

### Description

This file format is used to store the UID, SAK and ATQA of a NFC-A device. It does not store any internal data, so it can be used for multiple different card types. Also used as a header for other formats.

Version differences:

  1. Initial version, deprecated
  2. LSB ATQA (e.g. 4400 instead of 0044)
  3. MSB ATQA (current version)

UID can be either 4 or 7 bytes long. ATQA is 2 bytes long. SAK is 1 byte long.

## Mifare Ultralight/NTAG

### Example

    Filetype: Flipper NFC device
    Version: 3
    # Nfc device type can be UID, Mifare Ultralight, Mifare Classic

### Description

This file format is used to store the UID, SAK and ATQA of a Mifare Ultralight/NTAG device. It also stores the internal data of the card, the signature, the version, and the counters. The data is stored in pages, just like on the card itself.

The "Signature" field contains the reply of the tag to the READ_SIG command. More on that can be found here: <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf> (page 31)

The "Mifare version" field is not related to the file format version, but to the Mifare Ultralight version. It contains the response of the tag to the GET_VERSION command. More on that can be found here: <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf> (page 21)

Other fields are the direct representation of the card's internal state, more on them can be found in the same datasheet.

Version differences:

  1. Current version

### Description

This file format is used to store the NFC-A and Mifare Classic specific data of a Mifare Classic card. Aside from the NFC-A data, it stores the card type (1K/4K) and the internal data of the card. The data is stored in blocks, there is no sector grouping. If the block's data is unknown, it is represented by '??'. Otherwise, the data is represented as a hex string.

Version differences:

  1. Initial version, has Key A and Key B masks instead of marking unknown data with '??'.

Example:

    ...
    Data format version: 1
    # Key map is the bit mask indicating valid key in each sector
    Key A map: 000000000000FFFF
    Key B map: 000000000000FFFF
    # Mifare Classic blocks
    ...
  
  2. Current version

## Mifare DESFire

### Description

This file format is used to store the NFC-A and Mifare DESFire specific data of a Mifare DESFire card. Aside from the NFC-A data, it stores the card type (DESFire) and the internal data of the card. The data is stored per-application, and per-file. Here, the card was written using those pm3 commands:

    hf mfdes createapp --aid 123456 --fid 2345 --dfname astra
    hf mfdes createfile --aid 123456 --fid 01 --isofid 0001 --size 000100
    hf mfdes write --aid 123456 --fid 01 -d 1337

<summary>6. Sub-Ghz</summary>

## `.sub` File Format

Flipper uses `.sub` files to store SubGhz transmissions. They are text files in Flipper File Format. `.sub` files can contain either a SubGhz Key with a certain protocol or SubGhz RAW data.

A `.sub` files consist of 3 parts:

- **header**: contains file type, version, and frequency
- **preset information**: preset type and, in case of a custom preset, transceiver configuration data
- **protocol and its data**: contains protocol name and its specific data, such as key, bit length, etc., or RAW data

Flipper's SubGhz subsystem uses presets to configure radio transceiver. Presets are used to configure modulation, bandwidth, filters, etc. There are several presets available in stock firmware, and there is a way to create custom presets. See [SubGhz Presets](#adding-a-custom-preset) for more details.

## Header Format

Header is a mandatory part of `.sub` file. It contains file type, version, and frequency.

| Field         | Type      | Description                                                       |
| ---           | ---       | ---                                                               |
| `Filetype`    | string    | Filetype of subghz file format, must be `Flipper SubGhz Key File` |
| `Version`     | uint      | Version of subghz file format, current version is 1               |
| `Frequency`   | uint      | Frequency in Hertz                                                |

## Preset Information

Preset information is a mandatory part of `.sub` file. It contains preset type and, in case of custom preset, transceiver configuration data.

When using one of the standard presets, only `Preset` field is required. When using custom preset, `Custom_preset_module` and `Custom_preset_data` fields are required.

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---                       | ---                                                                                                                                   |
| `Preset`                  | Radio preset name (configures modulation, bandwidth, filters, etc.). When using a custom preset, must be `FuriHalSubGhzPresetCustom`  |
| `Custom_preset_module`    | Transceiver identifier, `CC1101` for Flipper Zero                                                                                     |
| `Custom_preset_data`      | Transceiver configuration data                                                                                                        |

Built-in presets:

- `FuriHalSubGhzPresetOok270Async` - On/Off Keying, 270kHz bandwidth, async(IO throw GP0)
- `FuriHalSubGhzPresetOok650Async` - On/Off Keying, 650kHz bandwidth, async(IO throw GP0)
- `FuriHalSubGhzPreset2FSKDev238Async` - 2 Frequency Shift Keying, deviation 2kHz, 270kHz bandwidth, async(IO throw GP0)
- `FuriHalSubGhzPreset2FSKDev476Async` - 2 Frequency Shift Keying, deviation 47kHz, 270kHz bandwidth, async(IO throw GP0)

### Transceiver Configuration Data

Transceiver configuration data is a string of bytes, encoded in hex format, separated by spaces. For CC1101 data structure is: `XX YY XX YY .. 00 00 ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ`, where:

- XX holds register address,
- YY contains register value,
- 00 00: marks register block end,
- `ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ`: 8 byte PA table (Power amplifier ramp table).

More details can be found in [CC1101 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc1101.pdf) and `furi_hal_subghz` code.

## File Data

`.sub` file data section contains either key data — protocol name and its specific data, bit length, etc., or RAW data — an array of signal timings, recorded without any protocol-specific processing.

### Key Files

`.sub` files with key data files contain protocol name and its specific data, such as key value, bit length, etc.
Check out protocol registry for full list of supported protocol names.

Example of key data block in Princeton format:

```
...
Protocol: Princeton
Bit: 24
Key: 00 00 00 00 00 95 D5 D4
TE: 400
```

Protocol-specific fields in this example:

| Field | Description                       |
| ---   | ---                               |
| `Bit` | Princeton payload length, in bits |
| `Key` | Princeton payload data            |
| `TE`  | Princeton quantization interval   |

This file may contain additional fields, more details on available fields can be found in subghz protocols library.

### RAW Files

RAW `.sub` files contain raw signal data that is not processed through protocol-specific decoding. These files are useful for testing purposes, or for sending data that is not supported by any known protocol.

For RAW files, 2 fields are required:

 * `Protocol`, must be `RAW`
 * `RAW_Data`, contains an array of timings, specified in micro seconds. Values must be non-zero, start with a positive number, and interleaved (change sign with each value). Up to 512 values per line. Can be specified multiple times to store multiple lines of data.

Example of RAW data:

    Protocol: RAW
    RAW_Data: 29262 361 -68 2635 -66 24113 -66 11 ...


Long payload not fitting into internal memory buffer and consisting of short duration timings (<10us) may not be read fast enough from SD Card. That might cause signal transmission to stop before reaching the end of the payload. Ensure that your SD Card has good performance before transmitting long or complex RAW payloads.

## SubGhz `setting_user` File

This file contains additional radio presets and frequencies for SubGhz application. It is used to add new presets and frequencies for existing presets. This file is being loaded on subghz application start and is located at path `/ext/subghz/assets/setting_user`.

### File Format

File contains a header, basic options, and optional lists of presets and frequencies.

Header must contain following fields:

- `Filetype`: SubGhz setting file format, must be `Flipper SubGhz Setting File`.
- `Version`: file format version, current is `1`.

#### Basic Settings

- `Add_standard_frequencies`: bool, flag indicating whether to load standard frequencies shipped with firmware. If set to `false`, only frequencies specified in this file will be used.
- `Default_frequency`: uint, default frequency used in SubGhz application.

#### Adding More Frequencies

- `Frequency`: uint — additional frequency for the subghz application frequency list. Used in Read and Read RAW. You can specify multiple frequencies, one per line.

#### Adding More Hopper Frequencies

- `Hopper_frequency`: uint — additional frequency for subghz application frequency hopping. Used in Frequency Analyzer. You can specify multiple frequencies, one per line.

Repeating same frequency will cause Flipper to listen on this frequency more often.

#### Adding a Custom Preset

You can have as many presets as you want. Presets are embedded into `.sub` files, so another Flipper can load them directly from that file.
Each preset is defined by following fields:

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---                       | ---                                                                                                                   |
| `Custom_preset_name`      | string, preset name that will be shown in SubGHz application                                                          |
| `Custom_preset_module`    | string, transceiver identifier. Set to `CC1101` for Flipper Zero                                                      |
| `Custom_preset_data`      | transceiver configuration data. See [Transceiver Configuration Data](#transceiver-configuration-data) for details.    |

<summary>7. Sub-Ghz Remote</summary>

The UniRF Tool *requires* the creation of custom user map with `.txt` extension in the `unirf` folder on the sdcard. 

If these files are not exist or not configured properly, **you will receive an error each time you try to select wrong file in the UniRF Tool**.

You can add as many `.txt` map files as you want, file name doesn't matter!

## Incorrect or unconfigured file error

If the `.txt` file has not been properly configured, the following error will be thrown when trying to run the UniRF Remix app:

```
Config is incorrect.

Please configure map

Press Back to Exit
```



## Setting up the `unirf/example.txt` file:

```
UP: /ext/subghz/Up.sub
DOWN: /ext/subghz/Down.sub
LEFT: /ext/subghz/Left.sub
RIGHT: /ext/subghz/Right.sub
OK: /ext/subghz/Ok.sub
ULABEL: Up Label
DLABEL: Down Label
LLABEL: Left Label
RLABEL: Right Label
OKLABEL: Ok Label
```

The UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/OK file locations must be set to the specific file you want mapped to that directional pad direction.

The ULABEL/DLABEL/LLABEL/RLABEL/OKLABEL variables should be set to the text to be displayed for each of the files set earlier.

## Example:

```
UP: /ext/subghz/Fan1.sub
DOWN: /ext/subghz/Fan2.sub
LEFT: /ext/subghz/Door.sub
RIGHT: /ext/subghz/Garage3.sub
OK: /ext/subghz/Garage3l.sub
ULABEL: Fan ON
DLABEL: Fan OFF
LLABEL: Doorbell
RLABEL: Garage OPEN
OKLABEL: Garage CLOSE
```

## Notes
* ##### App Usage
  - Press a button to send the assigned capture file.
  - Press Back button to exit app.

* ##### Universal RF Map
  - File path should not have any spaces or special characters (- and _ excluded).
  - Labels are limited to 16 characters.
    - Why? This is to prevent overlapping elements on screen.
    - For example: If you set your label or file to ```WWWWWWWWWWWWWWW``` you'll be over the screen limits.

<summary>8. Animations</summary>

## How do I make new animations?

I recommend watching this wonderful video for how to do it: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq5DXhOMo5s>. 

Quick notes:
- Dont git-clone Official repo, use ours. The new way we handle animations makes it a ton easier for you.
- Read the below text before trying :3 
<br><br>
## New Animation structure:

As you might have noticed, loading your animations as show in that video doesnt quite work anymore. This is because we are in Phase two of the new improved animation handler. Right now, it allows for two manifests (SFW & NSFW) which can ofc both be modified. In the future, it will allow for an infinite amount of animations.

The new folder structure as of rn is:
```
--dolphin
     |----sfw
     |
     |----nsfw
            |----lvl_1
            |----lvl_2
            |         \__frame_00.bm, frame_01.bm ...
            |                
            |----manifest.txt
```
In the future, this allows you to just create a new folder with any name, and drop your animations & manifest inside it. The firmware will have a slider to select your animation. Right now you can only modify these two folders with your custom animations.


## What does this change for me?

Not much, actually. For now, just make sure your animations and the manifest are in one of these folders, and for the manifest.txt there is only one important note: instead of `Name: lvl_8` it is now `Name: nsfw\lvl_8`. Simply adding *folderpath\\* to the name fixes your animations, and makes them compatible with the new and soon highly advanced animation system!
