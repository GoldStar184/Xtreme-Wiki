## Flipper Zero
Flipper Zero is a portable Tamagotchi-like multi-functional device developed for interaction with access control systems. The device is able to read, copy, and emulate radio-frequency tags, radio remotes, and digital access keys. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_Zero)

## What is XFW / Xtreme
XFW, also known as Xtreme is the Firmware written by us. Its a relatively new Firmware that has already gained over two thousand users in the first three weeks of its existence. This is due to the fact that it includes virtually all possible applications, receives constant updates that are based on what the community wants, has no restrictions unlike most other Firmware for the Flipper Zero and because the developers try their best to create a thriving community.

For a full in-depth info on what the Firmware can do, please check the [Readme](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme#xfw---xtreme-firmware-for-the-flipper-zero)
